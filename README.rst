Machine Translation Evaluation Exploration
================================================

Abstract
--------

Machine Translation is one of the important NLP tasks. Most of the MT evaluations do not consider the actual semantic meaning of the translation and source text. 
We present to you a new evaluation method that considers the distance of the translated text from the source text.

Using graph relations from babelnet.
